learning rust with advent of code

## learnings

- rust likes safety
- could not resist the temptation to solve day2 with python first, which I found as a more pleasant method of learning
- the type safety drives me nuts when reading/parsing files, I want to make aggressive assumptions, but not sure how I can tell rust to help me with that
- after some internal debate I concluded I am innit more for the points/challenge/puzzle coziness than learning a (great) language like rust at the moment
- for a fantastic intro to rust with aoc see: https://fasterthanli.me/series/advent-of-code-2022
